This is code for the paper "On the automorphism group of the axial algebra for $M_{11}$"
The main file with the various routines used is Automorphisms.m, while examples for the 
large algebras corresponding to $M_{11}$, the maximal subgroups $M_{10}$, and $L_2(11)$ 
are included as ASCII text. These can be read using eval Read();. For these algebra, if 
its dimension is n (for instance for $M_{11}$ $n=286$) then the MAGMA data file is A_n. 
In a magma session we can just read off as : 
A := eval Read("A_286");

The form for the algebras $A_n$ is in an ASCII text file "form_n", and can be read off again
using the same command. The files with the computations for $A_n$ are in the files "A_n.m", 
and can just be loaded in a MAGMA session using 
load "A_286.m";
again using $n=286$ as an example. 

The computations for Lemmas 6.27 and 6.28 are included in a single file: "Lemma_6_27.m". 

Various log files can be found for typical output in the logs subdirectory.

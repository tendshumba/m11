        We perform the nuanced algorithm for finding all axes in an axial algebra of modest dimension. (Works for up to ~40 on an old laptop running linux.) 
        This version only takes an algebra as input and attempts to find all axes in A. Additional (optional) inputs are : -one, the algebra identity if it 
        exists. The program will attempt to find this if the default is left as is, increasing run time, -form, the Frobenius form of A. Same as above. -Miy, 
        the Miyamoto group.
